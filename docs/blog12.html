      <p><em>
        This blog is based on my early experiences attending technical meetings and slowly learning
        that understanding a system is different from helping others understand it.
      </em></p>

      <hr>

      <h2>🧠 The Assumption I Started With</h2>
      <p>
        Early in my career, I believed technical meetings were about having the right answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I understood the system or the issue, I thought that was enough.
        So I joined meetings with logic in my head — but not always with clarity in my words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, I noticed something surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people influencing decisions were not always the most technical ones in the room.
        They were the ones who could explain what they knew in a way others could follow.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>🗣️ When Knowing Wasn’t the Same as Speaking</h2>
      <p>
        In my first few technical meetings, I mostly stayed quiet.
        Not because I had nothing to contribute —
        but because I didn’t know how to express my thoughts without either going too deep
        or sounding unsure.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I did speak, I jumped straight into technical detail:
        logs, flows, edge cases.
        By the time I reached my point, the conversation had already moved on.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s when I realized something important:
      </p>
      <p><strong>
        Technical meetings are not about proving knowledge.  
        They are about creating understanding.
      </strong></p>

      <hr>

      <h2>🎯 The Shift: From Explaining to Aligning</h2>
      <p>
        The change started when I focused less on the topic and more on the purpose of the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Was this meeting meant to solve a problem?  
        Was it meant to make a decision?  
        Or was it meant to align multiple teams?
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I became clear on that, my way of speaking changed.
        Instead of explaining everything I knew,
        I started explaining only what helped the group move forward.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>📚 Preparation Became More Important Than Confidence</h2>
      <p>
        The explanations that landed well were never accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        They came from reviewing the issue before the call,
        understanding its functional impact,
        and thinking about how to describe the problem simply.
      </p>
      <p>
        People may not see your preparation,
        but they always feel it.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>📝 Communication Doesn’t End When the Call Ends</h2>
      <p>
        Some meetings felt productive —
        but nothing changed afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
        That taught me another lesson:
        communication does not end when the call ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following up on what was discussed,
        capturing decisions,
        and making sure everyone left with the same understanding
        became just as important as speaking during the meeting itself.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>🌐 Client Meetings Taught Me to Translate</h2>
      <p>
        Inside the team, technical depth helped.
        With clients, technical language often created distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn’t want to know how the system worked internally.
        They wanted to know:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What problem would be solved</li>
        <li>What risk was involved</li>
        <li>What outcome to expect</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So I learned to translate —
        not to dilute the technical truth,
        but to express it in business and user language.
      </p>

      <h2>📌 Points to Remember</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Know the purpose before you speak</strong><br>
          Every technical meeting exists to solve, decide, or align.
          Your words should support that goal, not just display knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clarity beats complexity</strong><br>
          Deep understanding matters, but clear explanation matters more.
          If others can’t follow you, your knowledge stays isolated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Preparation creates confidence</strong><br>
          Reviewing the issue and structuring your thoughts
          makes your contribution intentional — not reactive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Communication continues after the call</strong><br>
          Decisions without documentation fade.
          Follow-ups and MOMs turn discussion into action.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Translation is a technical skill</strong><br>
          Explaining systems to non-technical stakeholders
          is not soft skill work — it is system thinking in another language.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <hr>

      <h2>✨ Final Thought</h2>
      <p>
        I stopped treating meetings as places to “sound smart”
        and started treating them as places to build alignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technical meetings are not where you demonstrate intelligence.
        They are where you turn understanding into shared direction.
      </p>
