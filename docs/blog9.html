      <p><em>
        This blog is based on a real experience I went through for nearly a year while working in a support project.
        It taught me a lesson no technical book or framework ever could.

      <h2>📌 Assigned Work vs Responsible Work</h2>
      <p>
        Early in my career, I believed that doing what was assigned to me — sincerely and on time — was enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assigned work answers the question: <strong>“What is my task?”</strong><br>
        Responsible work answers a very different question: <strong>“What will close this?”</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        I didn’t understand this distinction until I lived through it.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>🧩 The Problem That Wouldn’t Close</h2>
      <p>
        I was part of a support project and there was a long-standing issue in the application.
        It had existed for months — almost a year — and kept resurfacing with increasing user complaints.
      </p>

      <p>
        At some point, the task was assigned to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I tried my best — investigated, applied fixes, followed the usual steps.
        But nothing fully solved it.
        The issue stayed with me for more than six months.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was working hard — but I was still operating in <em>assigned mode</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>🔄 The Shift: From Task Ownership to Outcome Ownership</h2>
      <p>
        One day, I paused and decided to reset my approach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of asking, “What else can I try?”<br>
        I asked, “Why is this still alive?”
      </p>

      <p>
        I went back to the beginning.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Recalled and documented every step taken so far</li>
        <li>Reviewed the full history of the issue</li>
        <li>Identified all teams involved — directly and indirectly</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I started connecting across functions.
        I coordinated with <strong>three different teams</strong>,
        managed calls with <strong>around ten senior members</strong>,
        and ensured everyone was aligned on the root problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Superiors was supportive, which helped — but the real change was internal.
        I stopped waiting for instructions and started driving closure.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>📋 What Actually Helped Close the Issue</h2>
      <p>These were the practices that made the difference:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Early and deep analysis</strong><br>
          Understanding the complete history of the issue — how many times it occurred, in what forms, and under what conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear identification of all teams involved</strong><br>
          Including dependencies that were previously overlooked.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recurring sync meetings</strong><br>
          Keeping everyone aligned and reinforcing the importance of resolution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Structured MOMs and follow-ups</strong><br>
          Clear action items, ownership, and continuous updates via email.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intentional communication</strong><br>
          Speaking with clarity, backing points with examples, and creating space for questions and discussion.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <hr>

      <h2>🏁 The Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        The issue was finally resolved.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I later moved out of the support project into a development role,
        my client told me something I still remember:
      </p>

      <p><strong>“I’m not ready to lose you. I’ll call you whenever we need information.”</strong></p>

      <p>
        That felt like a personal win.
        Even in my appraisal report, my manager mentioned this incident —
        and it played a role in me receiving an <strong>X rating</strong>, the highest.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>✨ Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Assigned work keeps systems running.
        Responsible work improves them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early in your career, this distinction can quietly define your trajectory.
        Not through brilliance — but through ownership.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t need authority to be responsible.
        You need intent.
      </p>
